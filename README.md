# Multi-Search

Search multiple search engines at the same time.

## WARNING

Due to cross-domain restrictions this Chrome extension must filter out x-frame and csp headers in order to function properly. However it _only_ filters requests to these domains:
* https://search.brave.com/*
* https://www.google.com/*
* https://duckduckgo.com/*


## Install

To install the extension
* Windows -> Extensions
* Toggle Developer Mode
* Load Unpacked Extension
* Select the multi-search dir


## Usage

Type 'ss' plus a search term into the Omnibox to open multi-search in new tab.
