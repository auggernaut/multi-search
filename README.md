* https://search.brave.com/*
* https://www.google.com/*
* https://duckduckgo.com/*


## Install

To install the extension
* Windows -> Extensions
* Toggle Developer Mode
* Load Unpacked Extension
* Select the multi-search dir


## Usage

Type 'ss' plus a search term into the Omnibox to open multi-search in new tab.
